  author    = "Ferrari, Silvia and Cribari-Neto, Francisco",
  abstract  = "This paper proposes a regression model where the response is
               beta distributed using a parameterization of the beta law that
               is indexed by mean and dispersion parameters. The proposed model
               is useful for situations where the variable of interest is
               continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related
               to other variables through a regression structure. The
               regression parameters of the beta regression model are
               interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the
               logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a
               linear regression that employs a transformed response.
               Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide
               closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's
               information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is
               performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic
               normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic
               measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that
               employ real data are presented and discussed.",
