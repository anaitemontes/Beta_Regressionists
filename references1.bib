  abstract  = "This paper proposes a regression model where the response is
               beta distributed using a parameterization of the beta law that
               is indexed by mean and dispersion parameters. The proposed model
               is useful for situations where the variable of interest is
               continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related
               to other variables through a regression structure. The
               regression parameters of the beta regression model are
               interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the
               logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a
               linear regression that employs a transformed response.
               Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide
               closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's
               information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is
               performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic
               normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic
               measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that
               employ real data are presented and discussed.",

  author    = "Lorant, Vincent and Kapadia, Dharmi and Perelman, Julian and
               {DEMETRIQ study group}",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Despite an overall reduction in suicide, educational
               disparities in suicide have not decreased over the last decade.
               The mechanisms behind educational disparities in suicide,
               however, remain unclear: low educational status may increase the
               risk of suicide (``causation'') or low educational status and
               suicide may share confounders. This paper assesses whether
               educational disparities in suicide (EDS) are more likely to be
               due to causation. METHOD: The DEMETRIQ study collected and
               harmonized register-based data on mortality follow-up from forty
               population censuses from twelve European populations. More than
               102,000 suicides were registered over 392 million person-years.
               Three analyses were carried out. First, we applied an
               instrumental variable approach that exploits changes in the
               legislation on compulsory educational age to instrument
               educational status. Second, we analyzed EDS by age under the
               hypothesis that increasing EDS over the life cycle supports
               causation. Finally, we compared EDS in men and women under the
               assumption that greater EDS in women would support causation.
               FINDINGS: The instrumental variable analysis showed no evidence
               for causation between higher education and suicide, for men or
               women. The life-cycle analysis showed that the decrease of
               educational inequalities in suicide between the baseline 1991
               period and the 2001 follow-up period was more pronounced and
               statistically significant in the first three younger age groups.
               The gender analysis indicated that EDS were systematic and
               greater in men than in women: the rate ratio of suicide for men
               with low level of education (RR = 2.51; 95\%CI:2.44-2.58) was
               higher than the rate ratio in women (RR = 1.32;
               95CI\%:1.26-1.38). INTERPRETATION: Overall, there was little
               support for the causation hypothesis, suggesting that the
               association between education and suicide is confounded.
               Educational inequalities in suicide should be addressed in early
               life by early targeting of groups who struggle to complete their
               education and display higher risk of mental disorder or of
               mental health vulnerabilities.",
